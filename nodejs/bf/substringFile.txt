And what little they have promised they will not perform!
Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either.
This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch.
